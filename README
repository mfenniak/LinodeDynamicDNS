Requires the Python Linode API bindings from:

Usage, to update jack.example.com to match eth0's IP address:

    ./update.py --api-key=<linode-api-key> --iface=eth0 --root=example.com --name=jack

update.py writes a state file, prev_ipaddr, to store the IP address set by
the last invocation.  This prevents hitting the Linode API when the IP address
hasn't been changed.  Using the --force command-line option will ignore this
local check and force a remote check.

update.py also checks against the existing domain record to prevent updating
the zone file when it is not necessary.  Using the --superforce command-line
option will ignore the remote check and force a zonefile update.

It is recommended that you run update.py relatively constantly (eg. every
minute from crontab), and run update.py --force rarely (eg. every day).  This
will ensure that if your IP changes locally it will be updated quickly, while
minimizing the hits to the Linode API.  The occasional --force will ensure
that an accidental change in Linode's DNS manager is eventually corrected.
